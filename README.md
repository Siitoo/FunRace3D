The time it took you to perform the exercise:

-From 18:15h to 21:35h, the total is: 3:20h.

The parts that were difficult for you and why:The most complex part and that I decided not to add, has been the multiplayer, because I have not yet tried to make network connections from Unity.

-The movement in the scenario, because there are a thousand different ways to deal with the problem, with a Navmesh, moving positions, with a predetermined path... 
-In the end I decided to move positions because it's the simplest way, although not the best.
-And finally the respawn points, for the same reason above can be done in many ways and I would like to know which can be the most successful for this type of game.

The parts you think you could do better and how:

-As moving the player across the stage, I think the best way is to have a pre-defined path and have that player follow that path always.
-The obstacles, the wall animations that push can be randomized the frame in which they start to make it more interesting,
 the cannon balls reduce their size and the cannons placing them in diagonal positions.

What you would do if you could go a step further on this game:

-I would fix the movement and I think it would be very interesting to try to implement different movement mechanics,
 like jumps, dashes, crouching if you don't squeeze the screen.

What did you think:

-As a technical test it has been a great challenge to simplify it as much as possible and repeat the experience.
-As a very interesting game both the concept and the execution.  

Any comment you may have:

-On the multiplayer, at the moment in the university we are making networks through c++ and a game totally programmed in that language. In two weeks,
approximately we will make another game but with Unity and its multiplayer system, I'm sorry not to have faced the problem of multiplayer but as soon as I learn I will use this test to implement it.
-And thank you for the opportunity.
